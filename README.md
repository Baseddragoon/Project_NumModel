# Project_NumModel

This project deals with data from the company Rusty Bargain a car sales company. Rusty Bargain is training a model to calculate the values of car for an app for customers to be able to use. Rusty Bargain 3  biggest things they needed for the app are, the quality of the model predictions, the speed of the prediction, and the amount of time it takes to train each model. We are going to test several models and find out which one works the best for Rusty Bargain based on those 3 specifications. 

We start by doing all the preprocessing of the data. We have to fill the 5 columns that have missing data. 2 of those columns is missing 5% of data so those missing rows are just going to be dropped but we will fill the rest of the data in. After that we will mmodel a histogram of each of the car models coorisponding with their prices as well. After that we will start the model training process, however we have to encode our features as non numerical features such as Model type needs to be encoded to work for modeling. We then split the data and scale the data. RSME is how we are going to gauge the quality of model prediction here. The 4 models we are training are Random Forrest Regression, Linear Regression, CatBoost and LightGBM. We also trained the CatBoost Model both with and without hyperparameters.
